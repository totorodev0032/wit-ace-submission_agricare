# Building Block: Implementation of IIoT in Agriculture

Vision: To be indeed sustainable, we need a very broad perspective coupled with a bit of patience. Holistically, we need to have the broadest possible perspective which is always open to improvisations and discussions with the viewpoint of "Nature First".

To us, Sustainability is nothing but merely an optimization of an amalgam of Science and Technology. At the same time, we also need to acknowledge that to be truly sustainable we need to be rapidly slow before we begin to create a technology. We must begin to create the idea in our mind first to attain sustainability.

We are currently a part of “India’s Technological Transformation” but we need to embrace it thoughtfully; after closely observing the developed nations. The impact of unprecedented use of technology in some areas of the globe has taken a toll on nature ultimately.

The topic of this hackathon “Sustainability” was a boon for us which allowed us to develop a vision. We started compartartmentalising our idea and concluded that a holistic model - covering a broader spectre of crops along with several other factors (To begin with just 5) combined can help our nation. For that we have exploited Industrial Internet of Things in field of agriculture.

# Technological approach to solution

The topic of this hackathon “Sustainability” was a boon for us which allowed us to develop a vision. We started compartartmentalising our idea and concluded that a holistic model - covering an array of crops(eventually) along with several other factors(eventually) combined can help our nation. For that we have exploited Industrial Internet of Things in field of agriculture.

# Probable long-term impacts

Some of the solutions, we’re trying to achieve:-

- Water Management: Since farming is one of the most water-consuming sectors, we can use our product to maximize the efficient use of rainfall, groundwater and other resources, so that water doesn’t get wasted. It can be conserved for future use.
- Soil Fertility: With our product, we try to decrease the over-exploitation of agricultural land by using manures optimally(for supplementing) to increase productivity. Since we have the nutritional value of soil, we’ll recommend value that is only sufficient for growing a particular crop.
- Weather’s Impact on Crops: We’ll be continuously monitoring weather and its impact on the crop. We’ll recommend different ways and procedures that will help the crop thrive sustainably in any part of the world.
- Crop wellness: Continuous monitoring of crops with cameras and drones, we’ll be able to figure out problems and diseases in crops.
- Effective Farming: Our product focuses on effective water management, minimizing soil exploitation and decreasing farmers’ extra efforts. We will be helping to develop an effective way of producing crops.
